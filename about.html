<p>so while i was at work the other day, waiting for one of my servers
to build, i wondered to myself, how many of <a
href="http://twitter.com/aplusk">ashton kutcher's</a> followers
actually click on the links that he tweets, so i went ahead and built
a little program using the wonderful <a
href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a> and <a
href="http://bit.ly">bit.ly</a> <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API</a>. much
to my surprise, i found that on most occassions less than 1% of his
followers actually go on to click his links. see for <a
href="/u/aplusk">yourself</a>. on the 2/18/2010 i had some free time
and i just had to code (<i>very rapidly, mind you</i>) this up and
make it generic and available for one and all. go on and try some
users with some ridiculous <a href="http://twitterholic.com/">number
of followers</a>
</p>

<p>now, there are a few caveats. if, for example, 2 users tweet the
same URL, as far as I know, bit.ly gives both users the same URL, this
could overstate the click count. also, some URLs get retweeted like
crazy, once again overstating the click count.
